**TL;DR**: Our motion consistency model not only accelerates text2video diffusion model sampling process, but also can benefit from an additional high-quality image dataset to improve the frame quality of generated videos.

**All training, inference, and evaluation code, as well as model checkpoints will be released in the coming two weeks. Please stay tuned!**
